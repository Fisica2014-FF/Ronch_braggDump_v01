---- Read the text file "bragg_events.txt" ----

The file contains a sequence of events, and for each event:
- an integer identifier,
- a number of energy measurements,
- a list of integer numbers corresponding to the energy loss.

***
Create a function "read" taking as argument an input file stream 
and an array of integers to fill with energies and returning the number 
of points.

***
Create a function "dump" taking as argument the number of the event, 
the number of points and the array of energies and printing a dump 
on the screen.

***
Create a "main" function taking the file name from the command string, 
opening the file and calling the read and dump functions.
